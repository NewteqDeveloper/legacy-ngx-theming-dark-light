## About

This repository contains an example of a website built with Angular using CSS variables in order to change between a light and a dark theme. This is just an example of how this can be implemented. It should be used for reference purposes only.

If there are any changes that you feel should be included in the repository, please feel free to submit pull requests.

## Demo

Currently the demo page is unavailable. I am in the process of migrating the deployment page. Once it has been completed, this will be restored.
The page has been successfully transferred to work with github actions and is deployed on the current link, but it's broken. Still pending an update
~~You can find a demo of this site running at https://newteqdeveloper.github.io/legacy-ngx-theming-dark-light/~~
